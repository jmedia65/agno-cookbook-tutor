# Agno Cookbook Tutor

This project serves as an interactive tutorial to help you learn and understand the Agno framework through the examples provided in the [Agno Cookbook](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/tree/main/cookbook/examples).

## What is Agno?

Agno is a framework that enables you to build AI assistants called **Agents**. These Agents use AI Models (like GPT-4o) as their core intelligence and can be enhanced with various capabilities:

- **Tools**: Enable Agents to perform actions like web search or calculations
- **Knowledge**: Allow Agents to reference documents and information
- **Memory**: Help Agents remember context from conversations
- **Storage**: Provide a way to save chat histories
- **Reasoning Tools**: Enable step-by-step thinking for complex problems
- **Teams**: Allow multiple Agents to collaborate, either coordinated by a leader or working together freely
- **Streamlit Applications**: Build interactive web interfaces to chat with your Agents or Teams

## Tutorial Structure

This tutorial walks through the examples from the Agno Cookbook in a structured, educational format to help you understand the core concepts and build your own AI assistants:

1. Models - Understanding the AI engines behind Agents
2. Agents - Creating specialized AI assistants
3. Tools - Enabling Agents to perform actions
4. Reasoning/Thinking Tools - Teaching Agents to solve problems step-by-step
5. Knowledge - Giving Agents access to information
6. Memory - Allowing Agents to remember context
7. Storage - Saving conversation history
8. Teams - Coordinating multiple Agents
9. Streamlit Applications - Building web interfaces for your Agents

## Getting Started
