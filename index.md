# Agno Cookbook Examples Tutorial

Agno helps you build AI assistants called **Agents**. Think of an _Agent_ as a specialized worker that uses an AI **Model** (like GPT-4o) as its brain.
You can give _Agents_ **Tools** (like web search or calculators) to perform actions, **Knowledge** (like documents) to reference information, **Memory** to remember conversations, and **Storage** to save chats.
**Reasoning Tools** help _Agents_ think step-by-step.
Multiple _Agents_ can work together in a **Team**, coordinated by a leader or collaborating freely.
Finally, you can build interactive web interfaces using **Streamlit Applications** to chat with your _Agents_ and _Teams_.
